# 1. Copy this file to '.env' (`cp .env.example .env`)
# 2. Edit the '.env' file with your desired settings.

# These paths must exist on your host machine before starting the container.
# ==============================================================================

# --- Required: Paths on Your Host Machine ---
# Provide the ABSOLUTE path to the directories you want to use.
# Using relative paths like "./project_data/..." is also possible and convenient for local dev.

STT_MODEL_CACHE_PATH=/path/to/whisper_models

# --- Optional: Network Configuration ---
# The port on your HOST machine to expose the service.
STT_SERVICE_PORT_HOST=8088
# The internal port the FastAPI app runs on inside the container.
# This should rarely need to be changed.
STT_SERVICE_PORT_CONTAINER=8001

# --- Optional: Application Settings ---
# LOG_LEVEL: The logging level for the service (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, WARNING)
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
# CLEANUP_AUDIO: If 'True', the service will delete audio files from the inbox after processing.
